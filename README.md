Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases my personal portfolio website, highlighting my Experience, Education, Projects, Skills, and Testimonials. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is fully responsive and works great on mobile devices as well. Feel free to explore the code and make it your own! 🚀

## About

This portfolio website is a representation of my journey, skills, and accomplishments as a [your profession]. It provides an overview of my expertise, showcases my projects, and provides a glimpse into my creative endeavors. It also serves as a medium to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on interesting projects.
A static website is delivered to a user exactly the way it’s stored. That means that nothing on the page will change by the user or even the site administrator unless there’s a redesign of the site, or the site administrator goes directly into the code to change it.  
A static site is the most basic kind of website, and the easiest to create. It requires no server-side (also called back-end) processing, only client-side. Client-side technologies are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
No programming languages, including JavaScript, are required to make a static site. However, if a site utilizes JavaScript, but no PHP or any other programming language, it’s still considered a static site (since JavaScript is a client-side language).
Dynamic site examples include:

- \*\* E-commerce sites
- \*\* Blogs
- \*\* Calendars, or to-do sites
- \*\* Any site with information that must be updated regularly
